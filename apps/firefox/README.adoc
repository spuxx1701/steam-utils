= Firefox in Game Mode
:nofooter:
:href-script: https://gitlab.com/finewolf-projects/steamos-helpers/-/raw/master/firefox-in-gamemode/firefox-in-gamemode.sh?inline=false
:experimental: true

Runs Firefox in a KWin session if started in game mode. This allows Firefox's menus and fullscreen windows to work properly, as gamescope is only a minimal compositor.

** *From the Terminal/Konsole*

. Navigate to btn:[Library]
. Click on btn:[Add a Game] in the bottom left of the window.
. Click on btn:[Add a Non-Steam Game...]
. Click on btn:[Browse...]
. Navigate to the script you just downloaded.
. Click on btn:[Add Selected Programs].

== Usage

Simply run the added program you added from the Steam UI.

== Updating

To update the script to the latest version, either repeat the installation steps, or from the terminal/Konsole, run:

[source,bash]

If the script is executed while in Game Mode, KDE's window compositor (KWin) is started in order to handle Firefox's windows.
